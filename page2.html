<h1 class="gradient-ry" style="padding: 0px 50px;">Phishing</h1>
<p style="width:70%" class="pad">Phishing attacks are broad email attacks where attackers send thousands of emails to attract at least a few victims. T
    he attackers may intentionally include misspellings, poor grammar, and other obvious defects in the phishing email. 
    The purpose is to prevent aware victims from replying to emails and asking for additional information, which wastes the hackers’ time. 
    This ensures that only the gullible victims are targeted; problematically, only a few gullible victims click the email’s link. 
    Therefore, thousands of emails are sent to have the chance of attracting multiple victims.

<h1 class="gradient-ry" style="padding: 0px 50px; border-bottom:2px solid red;">Types of Malware</h1>
<h2 class="gradient-ry" style="padding: 0px 50px;">Spyware</h2>
<p style="width:70%" class="pad">The primary interest in spyware is using it to steal personal information for financial crimes such as identity theft. 
    The financial data can also be sold to other hackers on the dark web, who can execute unauthorized financial transactions. 
    Because people often repeat the same password for many different organizations, a stolen credential for one organization can be used to access the other organizations. 
    In addition, an insider in the company may use spyware to sensitive information regarding the company. They may use this for blackmail or sell the information on the dark web.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
<h2 class="gradient-ry" style="padding: 0px 50px;">Ransomware</h2>
<p style="width:70%" class="pad">Ransomware is a form of malware that prevents the victim from accessing their data till a ransom is paid prior to a deadline. 
    <br>
    <br>
    LockBit was the most deployed ransomware variant across the world in 2022. Using LockBit, hackers can attack victims using ransomware tactics. 
    Attackers using this software have attacked organizations across different sectors of varying sizes. 
    There is a wide range of techniques within the LockBit ransomware attacks that make it difficult to protect against. A
    ttackers publish the names and data of victims on a data leak site if they do not pay the ransom within time.  
    <br>
    <br>
    Ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) is a service in which a ransomware group sells its capable ransomware code to other hackers, who in turn use it to carry out their own ransomware attacks. 
    In 2022, Ransomware was the second most common attack. RaaS allows hackers with limited technical skills to carry out cyber-attacks. 
    This mutually beneficial business helps both the hackers who are purchasing the ransomware software and the group that created the ransomware software.  
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
<h2 class="gradient-ry" style="padding: 0px 50px;">Worms</h2>
<p style="width:70%" class="pad">A computer worm can quickly spread without human intervention. The virus self- replicates and spreads to different devices. 
    The self-replication makes a device lose storage space, making the device unusable. It could modify system files and install new malicious programs. 
    The worm executing automated emailing spreads the virus to other contacts. Performance issues, loss of files, identity theft, are consequences of worms.

<h2 class="gradient-ry" style="padding: 0px 50px;">Trojans</h2>
<p style="width:70%" class="pad">A Trojan virus, also known as a Trojan horse, is a type of malware that disguises itself as legitimate software.
    <br>
    <br>
    Zbot is a trojan that starts with a malicious link. 
    Then, a dropper is used to install malware on the local system and allow it to communicate with the Zbot central server. 
    The device then falls under the control of the person who sent the phishing email (the botnet owner). The botnet owner now has control of your data. 
    Zbot also has the capability to add malicious JavaScript code to a bank page and trick the user into providing their sensitive information.   
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
<h2 class="gradient-ry" style="padding: 0px 50px;">Other Malware</h2>
<p style="width:70%" class="pad">Fileless malware is an attack that takes advantage of vulnerabilities in legitimate software programs to inject the malicious code directly into a computer’s storage.
    <br>
    <br>
    Fake antivirus software acts like real antivirus software to convince the users that they have a virus, and that they need to download security software immediately. 
    However, when users click the link, malware is installed. Because the same logo is used on an antivirus software, the users do not perceive a threat.

<h1 class="gradient-ry" style="padding: 0px 50px;">Things That Can Be Stolen</h1>
<p style="width:70%" class="pad">Identity theft is when someone uses your personal information without your permission. 
    They could make purchases with your credit cards, get new credit cards on your name, and steal your health insurance to get medical care.   
    <br>
    <br>
    Healthcare records are valuable to customers because they can help hackers commit a variety of crimes. 
    The information can be used to commit identity fraud and take loans out on your name. Expensive medical services can be paid for hackers in your name. 
    These records also allow for tax returns to be filed, while someone is impersonating you. Healthcare data can be used against you for a long period of time while being undetected. 
    Credit card data is quickly found when compared to healthcare data. The information could then be used for phishing attacks, as well as blackmail.

<h1 class="gradient-ry" style="padding: 0px 50px; border-bottom:2px solid red;">What Else Do They Do?</h1>
<h2 class="gradient-ry" style="padding: 0px 50px;">Social Engineering</h2>
<p style="width:70%" class="pad">Social engineering tactics deceive victims to gain control over their information or their computer. 
    These forms of attacks happen with hackers doing background research to choose the best way to trick the victim. The attacker then uses pretexts, a background story intended to gain your sympathy, to gain the victim’s trust. 
    This is finally followed with the victim breaking security practices and giving the hacker sensitive information.
    <br>
    <br>
<h2 class="gradient-ry" style="padding: 0px 50px;">Double Extortion</h2>
<p style="width:70%" class="pad">In double extortion, cybercriminals take advantage of sensitive user data and threaten to publish it on the dark web, sell it to the highest bidder, or permanently restrict access if the ransom is unpaid by a deadline. 
    Organizations can get access to the data lost through backups; however, the data would still potentially be leaked after a double extortion attack.

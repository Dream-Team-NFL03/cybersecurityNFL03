        You've probably seen news about devastating information breaches when surfing the web, or turning on your TV. Perhaps, you've went to a site that your browser has flagged as suspicious, and, feeling suddenly uncomfortable,
        you revert back to the previous webpage you were in. You may have even gazed in confusion as a site rudely downloads a file with an extension you'd never heard of before. Almost everyone with access to the World Wide Web has seen or
        experienced security issues directly or indirectly.
        <br>
        <br>
        Though harmless pop-ups or advertisements are annoying, having lax security can lead to major deletions or unauthorized viewing/copying of your information.

        ways to combat them and keep safe from these modern pirates while surfing the web.

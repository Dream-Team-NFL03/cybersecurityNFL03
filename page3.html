<blockquote>&quot;You must exercise caution when downloading anything from public web sites, newsgroups, instant messaging sessions, or when opening email attachments&quot;<sup>1</sup></blockquote>
<p style="width:70%" class="pad">Malware takes advantage of vulnerabilities in your system; however, it relies on the user to install and run the malware by using social engineering techniques. 
    Malware also spreads between devices, when malware takes over your computer, it automatically emails itself to everyone in the victim’s contacts. The recipient is more likely to click on the link because it is from a familiar source. 
    Do not trust high-risk sources, such as websites with illegal content. When you are installing an application from the internet, make sure you read the fine print. 
    The fine print of a website could inform an individual if the software will monitor your actions or has the right to download more software. Make sure you are running the latest version of Windows.<sup>1</sup>

<p style="width:70%" class="pad">Maintain offline, encrypted backups of data. 
    Test and maintain the backups periodically to recover from a disaster recovery scenario. 
    Make sure the encrypted data backup is not connected with other systems, because hackers would delete those backups to force you to pay ransom.<sup>2</sup>

<h2 class="gradient-bp" style="padding: 0px 50px; width: 28%;">Dealing With Ransomware (Businesses)</h2>
<p style="width:70%" class="pad">
    For a business, determine which systems were affected and isolate them. Power down certain systems to prevent further damage from ransomware infections. 
    Follow the incident response and recovery plans. Some critical cyber security features include, Penetration testing, endpoint protection, proof-based scanning, vulnerability detection, and compliance processes. 
    Employees should be trained in cybersecurity to avoid potential attacks.<sup>3</sup>
    <br>
    <br>
    For businesses to secure their data, they should follow these steps: 
    <br>
    <br>
    <p style="margin-left: 50px;">
    1. Select an attack such as <a href="#" class="tooltip">exfiltration<span class="tooltiptext">getting data out of a targeted network</span></a>, brute force, stealing valid accounts, remote access software, and data destruction. 
    <br>
    2. Improve your security technologies against that attack. 
    <br>
    3. Test the cybersecurity technologies against the technique. 
    <br>
    4. Analyze the performances of the tests.<sup>4</sup>

    <blockquote>&quot;Use Multi-Factor Authentication. Using MFA helps to ensure your account’s protection in the event of an account compromise&quot;<sup>5</sup></blockquote>
    <p style="width:70%" class="pad">Be aware of offers, if they are too good to be true, then it probably is a trap. 
        To avoid spear phishing, when an attack is specific to one individual, make sure your social media account does not include too much personal information. 
        Hackers that view the victim’s life incidents are more likely to spear phish that individual.<sup>5</sup>
